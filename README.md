# D-FLIPDLOP-NEGEDGE

**AIM:**

To implement  D flipflop using verilog and validating their functionality using their functional tables

**SOFTWARE REQUIRED:**

Quartus prime

**THEORY**

**D Flip-Flop**

D flip-flop operates with only positive clock transitions or negative clock transitions. Whereas, D latch operates with enable signal. That means, the output of D flip-flop is insensitive to the changes in the input, D except for active transition of the clock signal. The circuit diagram of D flip-flop is shown in the following figure.

This circuit has single input D and two outputs Qtt & Qttâ€™. The operation of D flip-flop is similar to D Latch. But, this flip-flop affects the outputs only when positive transition of the clock signal is applied instead of active enable. The following table shows the state table of D flip-flop.

Therefore, D flip-flop always Hold the information, which is available on data input, D of earlier positive transition of clock signal. From the above state table, we can directly write the next state equation as Qt+1t+1 = D

Next state of D flip-flop is always equal to data input, D for every positive transition of the clock signal. Hence, D flip-flops can be used in registers, shift registers and some of the counters.

**Procedure**
1.Defibe Module:Define a verilog module for the D flip-flop with inputs(D,CLK)and outputs(Q,Q_bar).

2.Declare Inputs and Outputs:Declare input and output ports for the module.

3.Implement Flip-flop logic:write verilog code to implement the D flip-flop logic based on its functional table.Use a synchronous always @(posedge CLK)block to trigger the flip-flop on the positive edge of th clock single.

4.Simulate using testbench:write a verilog testbench to behavior of the D dlip-flop under different input conditions.

5.Apply INPUT Stimuli:In the testbench,apply various combinations of input stimuli(D,CLK)to cover all possible inout states.

6.verify output behavior:verify that the output behavior of the D flip-flop matches the expected behavior defined y its functional table.

7.Check for race conditions: ensure that there are no race conditions or undefined states in the design by analyzing the timing and seqence of input changes.
